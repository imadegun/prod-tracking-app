# Production Tracking App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Clean Code Standards
All code must adhere to clean code principles: meaningful names, small functions, single responsibility, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and comprehensive documentation. Code reviews must enforce these standards to maintain readability and maintainability.

### II. SOLID Principles
Every component must follow SOLID principles: Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. This ensures modular, extensible, and testable code architecture.

### III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory: Write tests first, ensure they fail, then implement code to pass tests. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced. All features must have unit tests with >80% coverage.

### IV. User-Centric Design
All features must prioritize delightful user experience: intuitive interfaces, fast response times (<2s for interactions), accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA), and user feedback integration. UX decisions must be validated through user testing.

### V. Continuous Improvement
Code must be regularly refactored for better performance and user experience. Performance benchmarks must be maintained, and user satisfaction metrics tracked. Embrace feedback loops for iterative enhancement.

## Development Standards

Technology stack: TypeScript/Node.js for backend, React for frontend, PostgreSQL for database. Use ORM for data access. Follow RESTful API design and semantic versioning for APIs.

Security requirements: Implement authentication/authorization, input validation, and data encryption. Regular security audits required.

Performance standards: API response times <500ms, frontend load times <3s, support for 1000 concurrent users.

## Quality Assurance

Code review requirements: All PRs require two approvals, automated tests must pass, and constitution compliance verified.

Testing gates: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests mandatory. Accessibility and performance tests included.

Deployment approval: Automated CI/CD with staging environment testing before production.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require: proposal documentation, team review, majority approval, and migration plan. Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for new features, PATCH for fixes.

All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with principles. Complexity must be justified with alternatives considered. Use this constitution for runtime development guidance.
