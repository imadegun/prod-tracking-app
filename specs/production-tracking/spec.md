# Feature Specification: Production Tracking System

**Feature Branch**: `002-production-tracking`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application system for tracking the production process in a ceramic craft company. Users can manage daily records of items processed by production operators. User Roles: superadmin, admin, inputdata. Admin users are responsible for creating weekly work plans for operators. Calendar Planning is the weekly work plan and targets for operators. Input Data users are responsible for recording the work results of production operators. Employees are operators who process production orders. Clients are customers who place orders (name, dept.). POL is a list of orders from clients (po_no, delivery, qty_order,...). Products are ceramic collectibles (code, name, color, texture, material, notes,...). Calendar is a weekly work planning system with a 5-day calendar period (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday), with optional overtime on Saturdays and Sundays. The work planning calendar is dynamic and can change due to several factors, e.g., targets not met, difficulty level, operator holidays, etc.). In the calendar, operators will be assigned to specific items, stages, order quantities, and production stages in the production process: 1. Throwing 2. Trimming 3. Decoration -> Decoration details (engobe, handle, carving, slab, extruder, texture, air pen, spray, stencil, etc.) 4. Drying 5. Bisquit Loading 6. Bisquit Firing 7. Bisquit Exit 8. Sanding/Waxing 9. Glazing 10. High-Fire 11. Quality Control The system will be able to track the items worked on by each operator, including the stage at which they are, the number of rejects, the reason for the rejections, and the stage at which they are rejected. The system can also track if the rejects exceed the production limit and provide an alert notification that the item needs to be remade. The system can generate weekly summary reports based on monthly targets divided by the number of weeks in the month and then determine whether the weekly targets were met in practice. The system can report which operators missed targets, which items were rejected the most, and the reasons why."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Admin Creates Weekly Work Plans (Priority: P1)

Admin needs to create and manage weekly production schedules for operators.

**Why this priority**: Foundation of production management - without planning, no work can be tracked

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by calendar creation and operator assignment functionality

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** admin accesses planning system, **When** they create weekly calendar, **Then** 5-day work week is generated (Tue-Mon)
2. **Given** weekly calendar exists, **When** admin assigns operator to production stage, **Then** assignment is saved with targets
3. **Given** production targets set, **When** admin adjusts for holidays/difficulty, **Then** calendar updates dynamically

### User Story 2 - Input Data User Records Production Results (Priority: P1)

Data entry personnel need to record daily production outcomes.

**Why this priority**: Core data collection functionality

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by data entry forms and validation

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** operator completes work, **When** input user records results, **Then** quantities and stages are saved
2. **Given** items have defects, **When** input user records rejects, **Then** reject reasons and stages are tracked
3. **Given** rejects exceed limit, **When** system processes data, **Then** remake alerts are generated

---

### User Story 3 - System Generates Production Reports (Priority: P2)

Management needs insights into production performance.

**Why this priority**: Critical for decision making and process improvement

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by report generation and data accuracy

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** weekly data recorded, **When** system generates reports, **Then** target achievement is calculated
2. **Given** production data exists, **When** management views analytics, **Then** they see operator performance and reject trends

---

### User Story 4 - Superadmin Manages System (Priority: P3)

Superadmin oversees all companies and system configuration.

**Why this priority**: System administration and multi-tenant management

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by company setup and user management

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new company joins, **When** superadmin creates company profile, **Then** isolated data environment is set up
2. **Given** company exists, **When** superadmin manages users, **Then** roles and permissions are assigned

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
