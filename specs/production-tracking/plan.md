**Structure Decision**: Monolithic Next.js application optimized for complex business workflows. Clear separation between admin and input user interfaces.

## Complexity Tracking

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Complex calendar system | Core business requirement for production planning | Simple scheduling insufficient for ceramic production workflows |
| Complex calendar system | Core business requirement for production planning | Simple scheduling insufficient for ceramic production workflows |
| 11-stage production tracking | Required for detailed quality control and bottleneck identification | Simplified tracking misses critical production insights |
| Dynamic planning adjustments | Business requirement for adapting to real-world conditions | Static plans become quickly outdated |

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication (Week 1-2)
**Goal**: Set up single-tenant architecture, authentication, and basic system setup

1. Initialize Next.js project with shadcn/ui
2. Set up Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
3. Implement database schema for single-tenant structure
4. Create authentication system with role-based access
5. Build admin system configuration interface
6. Implement middleware for role isolation

**Milestone**: Admin can configure system and manage users

### Phase 2: Master Data Management (Week 3-4)
**Goal**: Complete setup of operators, clients, and products

1. Create operator management interface
2. Implement client/company relationship management
3. Build product catalog with specifications
4. Add production order (POL) management
5. Create monthly target setting functionality
6. Implement data validation and business rules

**Milestone**: Companies can fully set up their master data

### Phase 3: Work Planning System (Week 5-7)

## Technology Stack Decisions

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Frontend Framework | Next.js 14+ | Full-stack capabilities, complex routing, excellent TypeScript support |
| UI Components | shadcn/ui + Tailwind | Enterprise-grade components, accessibility, customization |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Complex relationships, JSON support, ACID transactions |
| ORM | Prisma | Type-safe queries, schema management, excellent migration support |
| Authentication | NextAuth.js | Flexible role-based auth, secure session management |
| Calendar Logic | date-fns | Robust date manipulation, timezone handling |
| Charts | Recharts | React-native, customizable, performance optimized |
| Deployment | Vercel | Next.js optimization, global CDN, serverless scaling |
| Caching | Redis (Upstash) | Fast data access, session storage, background job queuing |
| Email | Resend | Reliable delivery, template support, analytics |

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Complex calendar logic | High | Thorough unit testing, business validation, phased implementation |
| Single-tenant data integrity | High | Database constraints, comprehensive testing, audit logging |
| Production data accuracy | High | Input validation, business rule enforcement, audit trails |
| Report performance | Medium | Query optimization, caching, progressive loading |
| User adoption | Medium | Intuitive UI, comprehensive training, iterative feedback |

## Success Metrics

- **Data Accuracy**: >99% production data accuracy, <1% error rate in reporting
- **System Performance**: <5s report generation, <2s page loads, 99.9% uptime
- **User Efficiency**: Admin planning time <30min/week, data entry <5min/record
- **Business Impact**: 95% target achievement visibility, 30% reduction in quality issues
- **Code Quality**: >80% test coverage, zero data corruption incidents

## Dependencies & Execution Order

**Phase Dependencies**:
- Foundation must complete before any business functionality
- Master data required for planning and tracking
- Planning system prerequisite for production tracking
- Reporting depends on complete data collection
- Polish phase requires all features functional

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Master data components can develop alongside authentication
- Reporting components can start early with mock data
- Testing can begin with foundation and continue throughout
- UI components can be built incrementally

**Critical Path**: Foundation → Master Data → Planning → Tracking → Reporting → Polish

## Integration Points

**With E-Menu System**:
- Shared authentication system (future)
- Common UI component library
- Unified deployment and monitoring
- Separate database schemas

**External Systems**:
- ERP systems for order data import
- HR systems for operator data
- Accounting systems for cost analysis
- Quality management systems for compliance
