- [ ] Implement operator assignment to production stages (11 stages)
- [ ] Add dynamic adjustment capabilities (holidays, difficulty, targets not met)
- [ ] Build overtime planning functionality (Sat-Sun optional)
- [ ] Create planning validation and conflict resolution
- [ ] **Milestone**: Admins can create and adjust weekly production plans

### Phase 4: Production Tracking (Week 8-9)
**Goal**: Implement daily production recording and quality control
- [ ] Create data entry interface for input users
- [ ] Implement production record validation
- [ ] Build reject tracking with reasons and stages
- [ ] Add automatic alert generation for quality issues (reject limits exceeded)
- [ ] Create remake workflow notifications
- [ ] Implement real-time dashboard updates
- [ ] **Milestone**: Complete production data can be recorded with quality monitoring

### Phase 5: Reporting & Analytics (Week 10-11)
**Goal**: Build comprehensive reporting and performance analysis
- [ ] Create weekly target achievement reports
- [ ] Build operator performance analytics (who missed targets)
- [ ] Implement product quality trend analysis (most rejected items)
- [ ] Add reject reason analysis dashboards
- [ ] Create monthly summary reports
- [ ] Build export functionality for external systems
- [ ] **Milestone**: Management has complete visibility into production performance

### Phase 6: Polish & Production (Week 12-13)
**Goal**: Performance optimization, testing, and deployment
- [ ] Add comprehensive testing suite
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Set up production deployment
- [ ] Create user documentation and training materials
- [ ] Performance monitoring and alerting
- [ ] **Milestone**: Production-ready system deployed and operational

## Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit test coverage >80%
- [ ] Integration tests for critical workflows
- [ ] End-to-end tests for user journeys
- [ ] Performance testing (<5s report generation, <2s page loads)
- [ ] Accessibility testing (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Security audit and penetration testing

## Deployment & Infrastructure
- [ ] Database setup (PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Redis caching setup (optional)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Environment configuration
- [ ] Monitoring and logging setup
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery

## Documentation
- [ ] User manuals for admin and input users
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Deployment guides
- [ ] Maintenance procedures
- [ ] Training materials

## Success Criteria Validation
- [ ] Data accuracy >99%, <1% error rate in reporting
- [ ] System Performance: <5s report generation, <2s page loads, 99.9% uptime
- [ ] User Efficiency: Admin planning time <30min/week, data entry <5min/record
- [ ] Business Impact: 95% target achievement visibility, 30% reduction in quality issues
- [ ] Code Quality: >80% test coverage, zero data corruption incidents
